# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Wisp Paper is a local-first literature library desktop app (collect papers, organise, preview PDFs, ask an LLM about the library), written in Rust with GPUI. Targets Windows and macOS; Linux compiles but is untested. The UI is Chinese-only: user-facing strings and error messages are written in Chinese, code comments in English.

## Commands

```sh
cargo run --release                     # run the app
cargo test                              # all three crates (workspace default-members)
cargo run -p wisp_cli -- help           # the `wisp` command line; `-- mcp` is the MCP server
cargo test -p wisp_core                 # engine only; no GPUI build, much faster
cargo test -p wisp_core store::         # one module's tests
cargo test -p wisp_core <test_name>     # one test
cargo test -- --ignored lookup          # live Crossref / Europe PMC lookups (network)
cargo clippy --all-targets              # expected to be warning-free
```

- The toolchain is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (clippy only). There is no rustfmt component and no `rustfmt.toml`: the code is hand-formatted with long lines and one-line `if x { return }` bodies. Do not run `cargo fmt`; match the surrounding style.
- Windows needs the MSVC build tools.
- Demo data: `cargo run -p wisp_core --example seed -- /tmp/wisp-demo some.pdf`, then `WISP_PAPER_HOME=/tmp/wisp-demo cargo run`.
- No API key at hand: `cargo run -p wisp_core --example mock_model -- 8787` is a fake Claude endpoint that always calls two tools and then answers. Point a profile in the demo folder's `settings.json` at `http://127.0.0.1:8787` and drive the window with `WISP_PAPER_DEV=open:0,page:ask,ask:<question>`.
- `WISP_PAPER_HOME` moves both the data folder and `settings.json` to one directory; use it for any manual run so the real library in `Documents/WispPaper` is not touched.
- Debug builds only: `WISP_PAPER_DEV=open:0,select:0,tab:pdf` scripts the window into a state at start (steps: `open`, `select`, `tab`, `page`, `wide`, `menu`, `search`, `ask`, `modal`, `settings:<page>`, `theme:dark`, `record:<shortcut id>`, `update`; see `dev_start` at the end of `src/app.rs`). The window does not take focus when it is set. `theme:` is saved to `settings.json`, so combine it with `WISP_PAPER_HOME`.
- `WISP_PAPER_UPDATE_URL` points the release check at another address (it must answer with a redirect to this project's release page).
- In a `#[cfg(test)]` module of a file that has `use gpui::*`, do not write `use super::*`: it brings in gpui's `test` attribute, and `#[test]` then fails with "recursion limit reached". Import the names you need.

## Architecture

A Cargo workspace of three crates. Dependencies point one way only: the app and the command line depend on core.

### `crates/core` (`wisp_core`): the engine, no GPUI

Everything that can be decided without a window or a socket lives here, and it is where nearly all tests are. That includes the pure halves of networked features: `lookup` builds Crossref / Europe PMC URLs and turns their JSON into a `Paper`; `ai` builds the context, the request body for both protocols (Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible) and parses stream lines into `StreamEvent`s. The actual HTTP (blocking `ureq`) is in the app's `src/net.rs`, whose tests serve canned responses from a local port.

On-disk layout: the data root holds one folder per library, each with `library.json` (`libraries`), `wisp-paper.sqlite` and `papers/` (`store`). Attachment paths in the database are relative to the library folder so a folder can be copied elsewhere. Removing a library or attachment moves it to `removed/`; nothing is deleted.

`store.rs` notes:
- The schema is one `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` batch guarded by `SCHEMA_VERSION` / `PRAGMA user_version`; a newer database is refused. Bump the version when an older build would misread the data.
- Deduplication is by DOI, PMID (`paper_identifiers`), then `title_key`. Trashed papers stay in `papers` (marked by a `trashed_papers` row) so they keep blocking re-import.
- `Store::in_memory` is what tests use.
- Status values are stored as English keys and shown through the label tables in `model.rs` (`SCREENINGS`, `READINGS`, …). The labels are not translations: the stored key `excluded` is displayed as 「相关」.

`tools.rs` is the one table of what an agent can do with a library; the command line, MCP and (next) the in-app assistant all end in `tools::call`, so a rule belongs there and not in a front end. `ai.rs` holds the model side of the loop: the request with tool definitions for both protocols, `TurnReader` (one streamed turn → text, tool calls, the message to send back), `tool_results`, and the slash commands (`SLASH`, prompt templates behind `/search` and `/cite`).
- A new tool is an entry in `catalog()` (name, Chinese description, JSON Schema) and an arm in `call_in`. Nothing else: `wisp <tool>` reads its flags off the schema (`cli_args`), and `mcp::handle` lists and calls whatever the catalog holds. The test `every_tool_is_callable` fails when an entry has no arm.
- Tools take `library` (id or name, optional when there is one library) and return JSON; an error is a Chinese sentence for the caller, person or model.
- All tools so far only read. When write tools arrive, the screening decision stays the person's: an agent may propose, never set `screening`.

### `crates/cli` (`wisp_cli`): the `wisp` binary

A thin shell over `tools` and `mcp`: argument words in, JSON out; `wisp mcp` is newline-delimited JSON-RPC on stdin/stdout. It is a separate binary because the app is a Windows GUI-subsystem program with no console. It opens the same data folder as the app (`settings::default_root` / `settings_file`), possibly while the app is running.

### Root crate (`wisp_paper`): the GPUI app

- `src/app.rs` holds all state in one root view, `Workspace` (`lib: Option<Library>` is the open library, `None` is the home page). Every click is a `Cmd` enum value, wired with `self.on(Cmd::…, cx)` and handled in `Workspace::run`. Popup menus are built from a `MenuKind` in `open_menu`; dialogs are `Modal` variants, built and submitted in `app.rs`.
- `home.rs`, `library.rs`, `detail.rs`, `chat.rs`, `dialogs.rs` are `impl Workspace` blocks that only render. A new feature usually means: a `Cmd` variant, its arm in `run`, and the element that emits it.
- Store writes go through `Workspace::change`, which runs the closure, calls `Library::reload` (re-reads papers, fields, files, trash and refilters) and shows a toast on failure. `Library::shown` is indices into `papers`, recomputed by `refilter`.
- Background work (PDF text extraction, lookups, chat streaming) runs on `cx.background_executor()` and comes back through `this.update`. Each task captures the library id (chats also a `generation` counter) and stops when the user has since closed the library or started a new conversation; keep that check in new async code.
- A library question's scope is the currently shown list (`lib.shown`), so view, search and filters change what the model reads up front. The context is built once with the first question of a conversation. Conversations are not persisted.
- The chat is an agent loop (`ask` → `chat_step` → `run_tools` → `chat_step` …, at most `MAX_CHAT_STEPS` requests per question). `Chat::wire` is the conversation in the protocol's own messages and is append-only: the model's turns go back exactly as received (`ai::TurnReader` keeps thinking blocks and their signatures), and every tool call gets a result even when it did not run. Tools run on the background executor with their own `Store` connection. Papers are named to the model by label (`P3`): `ai::resolve_labels` on the way in, `ai::add_labels` on the way out.
- `settings.rs` is the settings view (通用, 外观, 快捷键, AI, 关于). It replaces the page while `Workspace::settings_view` is `Some`; the open library stays underneath. There is no save button: each change writes `settings.json` at once.
- `shortcuts.rs` owns every key binding. `shortcuts::rebuild` clears and re-binds all of them (the text field's too) from the defaults plus `Settings::shortcuts`; call it after any change. While 设置 › 快捷键 waits for a key, all bindings are cleared and `Workspace::record_key` receives the key. A new shortcut needs an entry in `SHORTCUTS`, an action, its binding in `rebuild`, an `.on_action` in `home.rs` and an arm in `Workspace::shortcut`.
- Colours come only from `theme.rs`, which has a light and a dark set (`theme::dark()`); `Workspace::apply_appearance` picks one from the setting or the system. Do not hard-code colours elsewhere; text on an accent fill is `Theme::on_accent()`, a library colour is `Accent::strong()` / `soft()`.
- The release check (`check_update`) reads the redirect of GitHub's `releases/latest` (the JSON API is rate-limited per address). It only notifies and opens the release page; there is no release packaging or signing in this repository, so nothing is downloaded or installed.
- `input.rs` is the app's own text input (single / multi-line, IME via `EntityInputHandler`); `pdf.rs` renders pages with `hayro` on a worker thread into a virtualised list, keeping a bounded number of pages.
- `build.rs` embeds every file under `assets/` (of `branding/`, only `app-icon.png`) into the binary; icons are loaded by name through `ui::icon`. On Windows it also compiles the icon resource.

### `vendor/`

`gpui` 0.2.2, `taffy` 0.9.0 and `xattr` 0.2.3 are vendored with local patches and wired in through `[patch.crates-io]`. Patched spots carry a `quiet.md:` comment and are listed in `vendor/PATCHES.md`. When changing vendored code, add a row there and keep the comment; do not bump these versions without re-applying the patches. GPUI APIs here are 0.2.2 plus those patches (for example `grid_col_widths`, `ListState::estimated_scroll_metrics`), so check `vendor/gpui/src` rather than upstream docs.

## Scope

Ported from BiblioCell, without its datasets and web version. Being added step by step: the tool layer with CLI and MCP (done, read-only tools), the chat as an agent loop over the tools with `/search` and `/cite` (done), search sources with trial queries and batch import, a guide page for a new library that starts from a search, AI screening suggestions that the person confirms (鲸吞法: import broadly by query, let the agent judge, the person decides), scheduled source sync, and jumping to the quoted sentence in the PDF. API keys are stored in plain text in `settings.json`; when empty, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` are read from the environment.
